## ‚úÖ**Syntax & Language Basics**

This section introduces you to the **"grammar rules"** of JavaScript ‚Äî how to _write_ the code properly, so the JavaScript engine understands what you mean.

### üîπ What are Syntax and Language Basics?

- **Syntax**: Think of it like punctuation and grammar in English ‚Äî the rules of how to structure your code.
    
- **Language Basics**: These are the building blocks ‚Äî expressions, statements, identifiers, and how the interpreter reads them.

### üß± Topics Covered

---

### 1. **Comments**

Used to explain code or disable code without deleting it.

```js
// This is a single-line comment

/*
 This is a multi-line
 comment
*/
```

üëâ Comments are ignored by the JavaScript engine.

---

### 2. **Statements vs Expressions**

- **Expression**: _Returns a value._
    
    ```js
    2 + 3        // Expression
    x = 10       // Expression (produces a value)
    ```
    
- **Statement**: _Performs an action._
    
    ```js
    let x = 5;   // Statement (declares a variable)
    if (x > 3) { // Statement
      console.log("Hello");
    }
    ```
    

‚úÖ Every statement is **not** an expression, but expressions can be part of statements.

---

### 3. **Identifiers & Naming Rules**

Identifiers are the **names** you give to variables, functions, classes, etc.

Rules:

- Must begin with a **letter, $, or _**
    
- Cannot begin with a number
    
- Cannot be a **reserved word** like `if`, `return`, `class`, etc.
    
- Case-sensitive (`myVar` ‚â† `MyVar`)
    
- Best Practice: Use **camelCase** for variables and functions.
    

```js
let firstName = "John";
const $dollar = 5;
let _private = true;
```

---

### 4. **Semicolons: Required or Not?**

JavaScript has **Automatic Semicolon Insertion (ASI)**, which adds semicolons when it _thinks_ they're missing.

However, **not always correctly** ‚Äî especially in return statements or loops.

üü° Recommendation: **Always use semicolons** to avoid weird bugs.

Bad:

```js
return
{
  name: "John"
}
```

This will return `undefined`, not the object ‚Äî because JavaScript inserts a semicolon after `return`.

---

### 5. **Whitespace & Formatting**

JavaScript ignores extra spaces, tabs, and newlines. But formatting:

- Makes code readable
    
- Helps avoid syntax bugs
    
- Is enforced by tools like Prettier or ESLint
    

Example:

```js
let x=10;console.log(x); // Works, but hard to read

// Better:
let x = 10;
console.log(x);
```

---

### 6. **Case Sensitivity**

```js
let myName = "Sam";
let MyName = "Dean";
```

‚úÖ These are two **different** variables.

## üîç Summary (TL;DR)

|Concept|Meaning|
|---|---|
|Comments|Ignored by JS, used for explanations or disabling code|
|Expressions|Produces a value|
|Statements|Performs an action|
|Identifiers|Names of variables/functions, follow naming rules|
|Semicolons|Optional but recommended|
|Whitespace|Ignored, but proper formatting = good readability|
|Case Sensitivity|`myVar` ‚â† `MyVar`|
