**Lexical Scope in JavaScript: A Detailed Explanation**

---

### 🔍 What is Lexical Scope?

**Lexical scope (also known as static scope)** refers to the fact that the scope of a variable is determined by its **position within the source code**, and **nested functions have access to variables declared in their outer scope**.

---

### 🧠 How It Works

When the JavaScript engine parses the code, it determines the scope of all variables **based on where they are declared**, not where they are used or called from.

---

### 📚 Example:

```javascript
function outer() {
  let outerVar = 'I am from outer';

  function inner() {
    console.log(outerVar); // ✅ Can access outerVar
  }

  inner();
}

outer();
```

#### Explanation:

- `inner()` is **lexically inside** `outer()`.
    
- Therefore, `inner()` has access to `outerVar`, because it's defined in the outer lexical environment.

### 🧱 Lexical Environments

Every time a function is created, a **lexical environment** is also created. This environment contains:

- **Local variables** of that function.
    
- A reference to the **outer environment**, allowing the function to access variables from its parent scopes.

### 🏗️ Scope Chain

When JavaScript tries to resolve a variable:

1. It first looks in the **current scope**.
    
2. If not found, it looks **up the scope chain** (i.e., the outer lexical environments) until it finds the variable or reaches the global scope.
    

---

### 🧪 Nested Example:

```javascript
const a = 1;

function outer() {
  const b = 2;

  function inner() {
    const c = 3;
    console.log(a, b, c); // 1 2 3
  }

  inner();
}

outer();
```

Here:

- `inner()` can access `a` (global), `b` (outer), and `c` (local).
    
- This is possible due to lexical scoping and the **scope chain**.
    

---

### ❌ What It’s Not

Lexical scope is **not**:

- Determined at runtime (it’s determined at **compile time**).
    
- Affected by how functions are called (e.g., via `.call()`, `.apply()`, or events).
    

---

### 📦 Closures: A Key Application of Lexical Scope

Lexical scope enables **closures**, where inner functions "remember" the variables from their outer scope even after the outer function has finished executing.

```javascript
function makeCounter() {
  let count = 0;
  return function() {
    count++;
    return count;
  };
}

const counter = makeCounter();
console.log(counter()); // 1
console.log(counter()); // 2
```

Here, the returned function **closes over** the `count` variable, thanks to lexical scoping.
