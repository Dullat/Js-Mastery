## 🧠 Is JavaScript Interpreted or Compiled?

### ✅ The short answer:

**JavaScript is both interpreted and compiled.**

---

### 🕰️ **Historically (Early JavaScript)**

* JavaScript was an **interpreted** language.
* The engine **read and executed** code **line by line**.
* Slower performance.

---

### ⚡ Modern JavaScript (Today)

Modern engines like **V8** use something called:

> **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation**

This means:

* JavaScript is **compiled into machine code while it runs**.
* The engine does a mix of:

  * **Parsing** (reading the code)
  * **Compiling** parts into machine code
  * **Interpreting** some code
* This boosts performance a lot.

### 🔁 How it works (Simplified Flow):

1. You write JS code → `let x = 5;`
2. Engine **parses** it.
3. Engine **compiles** hot parts (frequently used code).
4. Rest may be **interpreted** if it's not used much.
5. Optimized machine code runs → Fast execution.

### 📌 Summary:

| Term          | Applies to JavaScript? | Notes                           |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Interpreted   | ✅ Yes                  | Some parts are interpreted      |
| Compiled      | ✅ Yes                  | JIT compiles to machine code    |
| Final Verdict | ✅ **Both**             | Uses JIT: mix of both for speed |
