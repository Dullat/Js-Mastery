```js
function createCounter(){
	let counter = 0
	return function(){ // We returned the anonymous function, and that function closed over the variable counter, so it retains a reference to it — even though counter is not returned itself.
		counter += 1
		console.log(counter)
	}
}

`The closure doesn’t copy the value of counter, it retains a reference to it even createCounter is destroyed.

  So when counter += 1 is executed:  

It updates the same original counter variable from the createCounter's scope
`
const counter = createCounter() // here we get onlyreturned fun

counter() // but that returned fun has remembered its lexical env

counter() // 2

counter() // 3
```

You're asking:


> If the `createCounter` function is done executing, isn't it destroyed? So how is the `counter` variable still alive?

---

## 🔥 Short Answer:

**No**, the `counter` variable is **not destroyed** — **because of the closure**.

Even though `createCounter()` finishes execution, the variables it created **stay in memory** **as long as they're being used by a closure**.

---

## 🧠 Let’s Break It Down:

### 1. When `createCounter()` is called:

```js
function createCounter() {
    let counter = 0;
    return function() {
        counter += 1;
        console.log(counter);
    };
}
```

- A **new lexical environment** is created with:
    
    ```js
    {
      counter: 0
    }
    ```
    
- A new **anonymous function** is created and returned.
    

---

### 2. This Returned Function **closes over** the `counter` variable

When you do:

```js
const counter = createCounter();
```

- You're storing the returned function.
    
- This function has a **closure** over the `counter` variable.
    
- **Because something (your returned function) still uses that variable**, JavaScript keeps the `counter` variable in memory.
    

---

### 3. Why Isn't the Environment Destroyed?

JavaScript uses **garbage collection** to free memory.  
But variables are only cleaned up when **nothing references them anymore**.

In this case:

> The returned function **is still referencing** the variable `counter`, so JavaScript **keeps it alive**.

This is **the whole idea behind closures**:

> Inner functions **preserve access** to the outer function’s variables — even after the outer function has returned.

---

## 🔁 Analogy: "Backstage Pass"

Think of `createCounter()` as a theater performance:

- The curtain closes when `createCounter()` finishes.
    
- But you gave someone (the returned function) a **backstage pass**.
    
- That pass still lets them walk behind the curtain and access the props (`counter`), even though the show is over.
    

As long as that person (function) holds the pass (closure), the props won’t be thrown away.

## ✅ Summary

|Question|Answer|
|---|---|
|Is `createCounter()` destroyed?|Yes, the **execution context** is gone.|
|Is `counter` variable destroyed?|**No**, because the returned function still references it.|
|Why does this happen?|**Closures** preserve the outer lexical environment.|
|When is `counter` finally garbage collected?|When the returned function (the closure) is no longer used anywhere.|
