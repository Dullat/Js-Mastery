### 🔁 The Code Recap:

#### 🔹 You have this in `loadProducts.js`:

```js
export function loadProducts(fun) {
  const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

  xhr.addEventListener('load', () => {
    // 1. products are loaded
    // 2. then your callback is called:
    fun(); // <- whatever function you passed in gets executed here
  });

  xhr.open('GET', 'https://supersimplebackend.dev/products');
  xhr.send();
}
```

#### 🔹 And this in your `testing.js`:

```js
beforeAll((done) => {
  loadProducts(() => done()); // 👈 you're passing a function that calls done()
});
```

---

### 🔍 Step-by-step: What’s Happening?

1. Jest starts running your test file.
    
2. It sees `beforeAll((done) => { ... })`, and gives you the `done` callback.
    
3. You pass `() => done()` into `loadProducts` — this becomes the `fun` parameter.
    
4. Inside `loadProducts`, after the `xhr` request is complete:
    
    ```js
    fun(); // ✅ This runs your `() => done()`
    ```
    
5. So `done()` is finally called → Jest knows:
    
    > “✅ OK, setup is complete. Now run the tests.”
    

---

### 🎯 You Asked:

> "Will `done` run in place of `fun()` in loadProducts?"

**Yes, exactly.**  
The `fun()` call inside `loadProducts` becomes:

```js
(() => done())(); // ← calling the function that calls `done`
```

This is how it notifies the test framework that async setup is finished.

## 🧠 Summary:

|Function/Param|What It Does|
|---|---|
|`done`|Provided by Jest, signals test readiness|
|`() => done()`|Your callback that calls `done()`|
|`fun()`|Inside `loadProducts`, this runs your callback|
|`fun = () => done()`|So `fun()` means → `done()`|

Would you like to refactor `loadProducts` to return a **Promise**, so you don’t need to use `done()` at all in tests? It makes things even cleaner.
