### What happens if a line starts with `(` but the previous line **does NOT end with a semicolon?**

JavaScript uses something called **Automatic Semicolon Insertion (ASI)** — it tries to guess where semicolons go if you leave them out.

But sometimes, when a line starts with `(` (or `[`, or a template literal `` ` ``), JS thinks that the new line is **continuing the previous line**, rather than starting a new statement.

---

### Example to illustrate:

```js
let x = 5
(x + 1).toString()
```

JavaScript reads it as:

```js
let x = 5(x + 1).toString()
```

Which is like:

```js
let x = 5(...something...)
```

— trying to **call the number 5 like a function** — which is invalid, and throws an error.

---

### So what is the rule?

- If the **previous line doesn't end with a semicolon**, and
    
- The next line **starts with `(`, `[`, or `` ` `` (a template literal)**,
    
- Then JS tries to interpret them as **one expression** — effectively **calling or indexing the previous line**.
    

---

### Why does this matter in your code?

Your code:

```js
let output = ''
(counter2 % 3 === 0) && (output += "fizz");
```

Without a semicolon after `let output = ''`, JS thinks:

```js
let output = ''(counter2 % 3 === 0) && (output += "fizz");
```

It’s like trying to call the empty string `''` as a function, which is not allowed.

---

### How to avoid this?

- **Always put a semicolon at the end of a statement** (especially before lines starting with `(`, `[`, or `` ` ``).
    
- Or start such lines with a semicolon, like:
    

```js
let output = ''
;(counter2 % 3 === 0) && (output += "fizz");
```

The semicolon **breaks** the previous statement and prevents the misinterpretation.

---

### Summary

|Without semicolon:|Misinterpreted as|
|---|---|
|```js|```js|
|let a = 5|let a = 5(a + 1)|
|(a + 1).toString()|(a + 1).toString()|
|```|```|

### What is REPL?

**REPL** stands for:

- **Read**
    
- **Evaluate**
    
- **Print**
    
- **Loop**
    

It’s an interactive programming environment that lets you:

1. **Read** your input (code you type)
    
2. **Evaluate** (run) that input immediately
    
3. **Print** the result of the evaluation
    
4. **Loop** back and wait for more input
    

---

### In the context of Node.js:

- When you type `node` in your terminal without a filename, you start the **Node REPL**.
    
- You can then enter JavaScript code **line by line** and see results immediately.
    
- It’s great for quick tests, experiments, debugging, or learning.
    

---

### Example of Node REPL:

```
$ node
> 2 + 3
5
> let name = "Alice"
undefined
> `Hello, ${name}!`
'Hello, Alice!'
> .exit
$
```

- You type expressions or statements.
    
- Node runs them and prints output.
    
- `.exit` quits the REPL.

### REPL vs running a file

- REPL: interactively type and run commands one by one.
    
- Running a file: execute all code in a `.js` file at once.
